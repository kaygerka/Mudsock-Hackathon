# Mudsock-Hackathon
For a Hackathon, we designed to help users plan and manage a garden by letting them add plants, set watering schedules, and visually organize their garden layout.

# How It Works
User visits the front page and clicks "Get Started."

On the garden page, the user can:
- Add a new plant (opens the form).
- Select plants for each plot in the grid.
- See plant images and get watering reminders.

On the plant form page, the user:
- Enters plant details and selects an icon.
- Submits the form, which saves the plant to Firestore and returns to the garden page.
